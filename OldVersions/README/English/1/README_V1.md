# Open Source Security Camera

`Security cameras aren't my thing, so this article is for linking to open source security camera systems with no known backdoors.`

# Research candidates

I do not like proprietary software, especially when it is used for security cameras. No matter what is said (256 bit encryption, military grade encryption, local, offline, etc.) you can never trust it, as the software is closed source and you can't verify their claims. We need to move towards completely open source security cameras, with not a single bit or byte being hidden from us.

## Free and open source security camera software

* [iSpy Connect](https://www.ispyconnect.com/) - Research needed

* [ZoneMinder](https://www.zoneminder.com/) - Research needed

* [Suggest more](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Open-source-security-camera/Discussions)

## Compatible hardware

_Unknown_

## Bad camera systems (proprietary)

* Lorex Mobile Eco

* ZosiView

* Wyze

* Ring (very bad, many issues have been noted with this software)
